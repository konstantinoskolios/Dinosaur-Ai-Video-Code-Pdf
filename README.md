# Dinosaur T-Rex Game with NEAT Algorithm

<img src="/preview.gif" alt="Preview" autoplay>




## Overview
Experience the evolution of gaming with our T-Rex dinosaur game, where the dinosaur learns to navigate obstacles using the cutting-edge NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies) algorithm. Watch as the dinosaur adapts and improves its jumping skills through natural selection, creating an immersive and challenging gaming experience.

## Features
- Play as a T-Rex dinosaur character
- Encounter various obstacles, including cacti and flying birds
- Utilize the NEAT algorithm for adaptive learning
- Dynamic jumping mechanism
- Keep track of your progress with the scoring system

## How to Play
1. Launch the game application.
2. Watch as the T-Rex dinosaur starts running automatically.
3. Obstacles will emerge on the screen.
4. Guide the dinosaur to jump over obstacles to avoid collisions.
5. Witness the NEAT algorithm gradually enhance the dinosaur's ability to overcome obstacles.
6. The game concludes if the dinosaur collides with an obstacle.
7. Track your progress with the scoring system, reflecting how far the dinosaur has advanced.
